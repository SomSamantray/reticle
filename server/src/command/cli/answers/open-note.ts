/**
 * What `reticle open` says when it launched a URL and no session appeared.
 *
 * `open` resolves the port leniently on purpose: if nothing is on the port you asked for, it finds a
 * running daemon instead, so nobody has to hunt for the port. That is the right default and it has
 * one sharp edge — when it substitutes, the command is now talking to a DIFFERENT daemon than the
 * caller named, and every subsequent sentence is about that other daemon.
 *
 * Observed driving this repo's own fixture: `open --port 4470` found nothing there, silently used a
 * daemon on 4400, and reported that the app "carries no Reticle SDK, or dials a port other than
 * 4400". The app was wired and was dialling 4470 exactly as asked. Reticle knew both numbers and
 * reported neither, so the one actionable fact — you are pointed at the wrong daemon — was the only
 * thing missing, and the advice given instead was to re-run `init` on a correctly installed app.
 *
 * That is the same shape as the field reports where a daemon in the wrong repo produced a diagnosis
 * blaming the app: an absence explained by a cause the daemon had already ruled out.
 *
 * So the substitution is stated FIRST, with both numbers, before any cause that assumes they match.
